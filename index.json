Kobilca private life and her art work. On one side I focused on different kinds of illustration of her work through my hands; from hand illustration to digital illustration and jacquard woven textile illustration. I also did a hand-woven portrait. On the other side, I played with collaging her artworks with a very spontanious ripping of the paper.\nI was inspired by her saying \u0026lsquo;vse sem hotela videti \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; which I also included in the final design. Exposing and hiding the eyes - do you see the wonders of the world too?\nTwo of my designs were sellected by the National Gallery in Ljubljana to be printed on notebook covers, which are available in the museums shop.\n    Mentor: Katja Burger Kovič, Arijana Gadžijev, Marija Jenko\n","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020-04-01-ivana-kobilca/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;ENI OD SEDMIH MILIJARD\u0026rdquo; url: Eni od Sedmih Milijard date: 2020-04-03 description: \u0026ldquo;Look up, you don\u0026rsquo;t need stars to recall memories\u0026rdquo; type: \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; image: \u0026ldquo;EO7M (66).jpg\u0026rdquo; categories:\n \u0026ldquo;clothes\u0026rdquo; model: \u0026ldquo;Eni od Sedmih Milijard\u0026rdquo; photo: \u0026ldquo;Bernarda Rupnik\u0026rdquo; styling: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo;     Eni od Sedmih Milijard is a Slovenian band creating indie-folk music; bringing people together, telling stories, sharing heart-warming melodies.\n                                    ","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020-04-03-eo7m/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;NANA x ZALA\u0026rdquo; url: nana zala date: 2020-05-26 description: \u0026ldquo;The last scraps\u0026rdquo; type: \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; image: \u0026ldquo;3c.jpg\u0026rdquo; categories:\n \u0026ldquo;collaboration\u0026rdquo; model: \u0026ldquo;Ela Mejač\u0026rdquo; photo: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo;   NANA x ZALA COLLAB\nUpcycled shirts for a better and greener tomorrow.\n                Collection of 3 upcycled shirts made in collaboration with slovenian artist Nana Irgolič, who embroidered lovely illustrations on redesigned second hand shirt made by me.\n        Digital collages made by me with intention to bring tenderness into a concrete jungle.\n                      ","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020-05-26-nana-x-zala/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;DANA\u0026rdquo; url: Dana Verc date: 2020-08-01 description: \u0026ldquo;Swapping clothes with my friends is always fun\u0026rdquo; type: \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; image: \u0026ldquo;naslovna.jpg\u0026rdquo; categories:\n \u0026ldquo;portraits\u0026rdquo; model: \u0026ldquo;Dana Verč\u0026rdquo; photo: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo; styling: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo;     On friday, thanks to lovely Kresna Dara, I met with Dana, drinking the best ginger-lemonade in Kavarna Moderna (yum! very much recomend it ) we talked about life, sustainability and shopping habits.\n        Dana // The people I hang out with mostly; their habits are driven by the zero-waste thinking. It is just normal to us; buying secondhand, using reusable or zero-waste products such as textile pads, makeup removal cloths, metal razor, shampoo bars\u0026hellip; I also bring my own cutlery when going out for picnic! And swapping clothes with my friends is always fun.\n  I know there is no happy medium in what you do, but I think there still is a lot of people who don’t think about bad environmental causes or other negative sides to wasteful living at all. I don’t think we talk about it enough.\n            Throwaway fashion is putting increasing pressure on our planet and its people - it’s unsustainable. And did you know it would take 13 years for one person to drink the water needed to make one cotton t-shirt and a pair of jeans? Choosing to shop second hand can help.\n      Dana is wearing my patchwork sweater made from waste knitwear scraps damaged in factory procces but put together in their loveliest way.\n      ","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020_08_01_dana-verc/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;KRESNA DARA\u0026rdquo; url: Kresna Dara date: 2020-08-02 description: \u0026ldquo;When was the last time you observed the stars?\u0026rdquo; type: \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; image: \u0026ldquo;naslovna.jpg\u0026rdquo; categories:\n \u0026ldquo;portraits\u0026rdquo; model: \u0026ldquo;Kresna Dara\u0026rdquo; photo: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo; styling: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo;     I met Kresna a few years ago, such a lovely human being. Catching the last summer rays, we walked down the old streets of Ljubljana to capture these moments and talk about all different topics.\n        Kresna // When was the last time you observed the stars? Or sunset? Isn’t nature just beautiful? How everything is connected; everything has a purpose. It is so beautiful to care for it, to care for ourselves.\n        When visiting Morocco, I saw trash and plastic everywhere; but people live there in such poverty, caring for pollution is probably their last thought. Maybe because of lack of education they don’t even know the consequences.\n        So I feel grateful, being educated to know what I can do to play my part for a better future. Just having your own glass water-bottle and a reusable textile shopping bag is a step forward! I know it can be very time consuming to plan your zero-waste steps and in some cases also expensive.\n        But being balanced and doing best you can do in your own abilities - that should drive you on! Start with small steps and don’t be harsh to yourself.\n  Actually; we all could use some love and support from each other in this process.\n              *Kresna is wearing an upcycled knitwear top; material is from a local knitting studio and couldn’t be used in the further production because of some small yarn mistakes\n  ","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020_08_02_kresna-dara/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;ANA \u0026amp; PRIMOŽ\u0026rdquo; url: Ana Primoz date: 2020-08-03 description: \u0026ldquo;How do you like your flowers?\u0026rdquo; type: \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; image: \u0026ldquo;naslovna.jpg\u0026rdquo; categories:\n \u0026ldquo;portraits\u0026rdquo; model: \u0026ldquo;Ana and Primož Godec\u0026rdquo; photo: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo; styling: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo;     Ana is my older sister, ex-roomie and with Primož at her side as her husband; my favourite brother-in-law (I’m sorry Franci, you are awesome too) - a great role model to relationship, adventurous exploration and lifestyle.\n        Ana \u0026amp; Primož // Currently I am finishing my master’s degree in Cognitive Science and Primož works as a programmer; mainly dealing with neural networks. Basically, we could say neurons connect us! And lately we both were occupied with our new project - setting up a website about different medicinal herbs and flowers, that you can find in nature and use to ease some problems of yours; describing their effects on health and most important information needed for collecting them. Our webpage is super user-friendly; you only click on a tag of what bothers you and you will be served with all flowers that can help with your problem. It is in Slovene and you can check it at Naberi čaj\n          In the last two years we are really trying to live a zero-waste life as much as possible and think about our Mother Nature; we ride bikes in Ljubljana all the time, we have our own garden where we grow our vegetables and also store them for the winter, we avoid using plastic packaging and use a textile shopping bag. There still is a lot that can be done and we are learning and trying to be better everyday.\n        Otherwise we love being outdoors; caring for our garden, going on longer hikes, collecting flowers on the way and then sleeping in a tent. For us this is an escape from our comfortable life, to reset our minds.\n        ","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020_08_03_ana-primoz/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;MAJA GAZVODA\u0026rdquo; url: Maja Gazvoda date: 2020-08-04 description: \u0026ldquo;“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” – Jim Rohn\u0026rdquo; type: \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; image: \u0026ldquo;naslovna.jpg\u0026rdquo; categories:\n \u0026ldquo;portraits\u0026rdquo; model: \u0026ldquo;Maja Gazvoda\u0026rdquo; photo: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo; styling: \u0026ldquo;Zala Hrastar\u0026rdquo;         Maja is such a lovely, sunny person. I love talking to her about anything, she is very positive and encouraging, just gives me the boost to keep going. And not to mention - working with her is always so much fun! She really has a heart at that right spot.\nRegardless of coming from nearby places, I only remember meeting her later in high school when we both presented one of our first designs on a charity fashion show. And then our world slowly started to interwine. And I will always be grateful for knowing her.\n        Maja / I am interested in many different things; I love meeting new people, designing and experiencing things that have a positive impact on environment or the people around me.\nThe most important matter to me are relationships; choosing the right people for yourself and then intentionally nurturing the relationship. A good relationship to me is when people give to each other, and not only take. And when you give good out, good returns. Because who you are with, has a big impact on how you think, act, behave - so choose people you like being around wisely, people who influence positively on your mindset.\n        I value honesty, family, imagination, openness, friends, learning \u0026hellip; Staying on the level of being open to learning new things; always leaving a room for new knowledge - having a reason to keep you going, always setting up new goals. Always being curious.\nI love working in a team where we share our values despite coming from different fields of interests; being a part of Beesmetic trio, I really learned what it means to learn and grow together as a team; the importance of listening and encouraging one another. It contributes to our personal growth too; we actually set up our own little library - each buys specific books and then we share them with each other so we all get knowledge from different fields of study.\nComing from the artistic fields, I find the process of research and development very interesting; at one moment you are super excited and the next moment you don’t really know what the heck you are doing. This constant changeable curve; but you know when you are down you gotta focus on the solution and the only way forward is up! But you gotta keep in mind that not every project is gonna be super great and awesome; you just gotta finish it and not overthink too much. Then make room for new ones. Not every thing is gonna be an innovation or is gonna change the world. What matters at the end is the sum of everything you do, all the important lessons you learned on the way. All the people you met and worked with.\n      I\u0026rsquo;ve heard a lot about having a rutine; either morning or evening. I must admit, I don\u0026rsquo;t have one just yet and I also don\u0026rsquo;t wanna worry about it too much, even though I know it is good to have one – I understand it as a discipline. And when you are disciplined at one thing, you can get disciplined at other too… I am working on establishng an evenig rutine – not scrolling through smart phone, but reading a book before sleep instead. And most importantly, going to bed earlier! It would also be amazing if I woke up with my first alarm, and not snoozing it over and over.\nOnce I read a really good quote – \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;You are responsible for everything good or bad that happens to you in your life.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; Yes, it is your responsibility wether you are gonna be lazy today or are you gonna make the day count. Everything we do, has consequences. So I always try to remind myself of it.\n        When I was 15, I started writing a blog. I was under pressure of beliving I already missed everything, so I had to start writing ASAP. But I had no idea what I was really doing, only later I realised a blog has to have one cohesive thread. I wrote a lot in the beginning, but then it all started to resent to me and I stopped. I realised I was only doing it for other people, It felt as an obligation. Only when I cleared it out with myself, why I am doing it, I started to enjoy it again. To me it is a space where I put out my thinking, my creating. When I\u0026rsquo;m inspired, I just write and write. It\u0026rsquo;s not my primary thing, but I like to share with the world something I am proud of there. And when this also interests other people, it\u0026rsquo;s only a plus. So yeah, I didn\u0026rsquo;t give up on it. But I opened up to myself, and my honesty led me to another level.\nSo my advice to you is to be honest with yourself, in what you do and in the relationships you have. Be clear with yourself in what you want. Having a clear communication of what you feel and see. Let the words match with your actions, learn to present your ideas with words. And be confident in what you do, always.\n  ","permalink":"https://morja.si/2020_08_04_maja-g/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"title: \u0026ldquo;TINKARA LEDNIK\u0026rdquo; url: Tinkara Lednik date: 2020-08-05 description: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Making memories that will last forever.
